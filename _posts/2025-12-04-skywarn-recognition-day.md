This year's Skywarn Recognition Day will be observed differently due to scheduling conflicts at the National Weather Service office.

## What is Skywarn Recognition Day?

Skywarn Recognition Day celebrates the contributions that amateur radio operators make to the National Weather Service during severe weather events. Skywarn spotters provide critical ground-truth reports that help forecasters issue timely warnings.

## Get Involved

Even though the formal event won't take place as usual this year, we encourage all members to:

- Complete Skywarn spotter training if you haven't already
- Check into our weekly nets
- Be prepared to assist during severe weather

Stay tuned for updates about alternative activities.
