It is with great regret that we announce the passing of an ardent supporter, Lifetime Associate Member, and one of the main reasons we have a presence on the Yorktown at Patriots Point, RADM James Henry Flatley III USN (Ret).  Admiral Flatley was a Naval Aviator and commanded the USS Saratoga Aircraft Carrier.  He was the first Executive Director of Patriots Point and fully supported the 2m/440 repeater mounted on the carrier and fully supported the CARS club room in the forward steering compartment.  The club voted him in as an Associate Lifetime Member for his support and guidance.

His presence and support will be sorely missed.
