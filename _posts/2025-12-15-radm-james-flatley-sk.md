We note with sadness the passing of Rear Admiral James Flatley III, a distinguished naval aviator and longtime supporter of amateur radio.

RADM Flatley served with distinction throughout his naval career and was a friend to our club and the amateur radio community. His support of our operations aboard the USS Yorktown will not be forgotten.

Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time.

Silent Key - Rest in Peace.
