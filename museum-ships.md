    <h2>Museum Ships Weekend</h2>
    <p>Museum Ships Weekend occurs annually in June. Amateur radio operators around the world activate historic naval vessels to make contact with other radio enthusiasts. It's a unique opportunity to operate from these historic ships and connect with maritime history.</p>

    <p>The USS Yorktown is our primary vessel for museum ships operations. This historic aircraft carrier served in World War II and the Vietnam War, and now serves as a museum ship at Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant, SC.</p>
