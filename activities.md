    <h2>Newcomers Net</h2>
    <p>Our weekly Newcomers Net is an informal gathering where all hams can meet and get acquainted with each other. It's a great way to get started in amateur radio and learn from experienced operators.</p>
    <p>The net features structured check-in procedures and designated time for "rag chew" conversations among participants.</p>

    <h2>Emergency Communications</h2>
    <p>CARS members are active in emergency communications through ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service). We maintain an emergency trailer with full communication capabilities and provide support during severe weather and public events.</p>
