CARS conducts amateur radio training classes periodically. We use a one-and-a-half day review format, and bring in a test team after lunch on the second day. These classes are generally done on request by a community group, and we prefer 10-20 students. Most groups will allow outsiders to attend as well. There is no cost for the training, though you should purchase and review a training manual for yourself ahead of time. To request a class contact us at CARSinfo@wa4usn.org.

CARS works with a Laurel-accredited volunteer examiner (VE) team. The team holds exam sessions on the second Saturday of  April, June, August, October, and December at 9 am at the Tall Pines Baptist Church in Ladson, SC (next to the American Biker store). February sessions are held at the Charleston Hamfest on the first Saturday at 1 pm.  Walk-ins are accepted, but pre-registration for these sessions is strongly preferred.  A valid email address is required.

To register for a test session, go to https://hamstudy.org/sessions/laurel/29407/inperson

In order to take a test, you are required to bring the following to the VE session:

A photo ID, or two non-photo IDs

Your Federal Registration Number (FRN). If you do not already have one, go to the FCC Registration site and request a FRN. If you already have an amateur or GMRS license, you have an FRN. The FCC will not accept a SSN on your application.*

A filled-out Laurel VEC application. We use this information to create the Form 605 application for the FCC.*

If you are already licensed, the original and copy for us of your license.*

If you have any Certificates of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCEs) that have not been used for license credit, bring the original and a copy for us of each CSCE.

If you are applying for credit for an expired pre-1987 General class license, bring proof of that license. A copy of an old call book showing your record should be sufficient.*
* these items can be provided to us prior to the test session through pre-registration.

Starting on 19 April 2022 the FCC charges $35 for licenses (initial grant, renewal, vanity call application). The VE team does not handle those transactions; you will work directly with the FCC. In short, when your application is submitted, the FCC will email you instructions for payment. You will have ten days to pay. 

Another local team, VE of SC, holds test sessions on the third Wednesday night of each month at 7 pm. Pre-registration is encouraged.
